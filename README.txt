Base 64 encoder and decoder

Requires three parameters in the command line:
 1. a flag "-e" for encoding, and "-d" for decoding
 2. input filename followed by a space
 3. output filename followed by a semicolon ";"

Both input file and output file must exist, the program doesn't create them

example:
Base64Tool.exe -e input.txt output.txt;

Create the .exe file and run it with Turbo Debugger
